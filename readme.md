# üé∏ BandConnect

## **BandConnect** is a full-stack capstone project that brings fans closer to their favorite music band. The platform allows users to view concert pictures, read song lyrics, check upcoming events, register for concerts, and manage their reservations ‚Äî all in one seamless experience.

## üß± System Architecture

![System Design](system_architecture.png)

This diagram shows the interaction between the user, Django main site, Flask microservices, and the databases:

- **Django** runs on IBM Kubernetes Service and interacts with:
  - A Flask microservice on IBM Code Engine (pictures)
  - A Flask + MongoDB microservice on RedHat OpenShift (songs)
- Data is stored in **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **IBM Cloud Object Storage**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### üîπ Microservices

- **Flask** for building REST APIs

  - **Get Pictures Service**
    Serves images from past concerts with full CRUD support.

    **Endpoints:**

    | Action | Method | Return Code    | Body                               | URL Endpoint    |
    | ------ | ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
    | List   | GET    | 200 OK         | Array of picture URLs `[{...}]`    | `/picture`      |
    | Create | POST   | 201 CREATED    | A picture resource as JSON `{...}` | `/picture`      |
    | Read   | GET    | 200 OK         | A picture as JSON `{...}`          | `/picture/{id}` |
    | Update | PUT    | 200 OK         | A picture as JSON `{...}`          | `/picture/{id}` |
    | Delete | DELETE | 204 NO CONTENT | `""`                               | `/picture/{id}` |

  - **Get Songs Service**
    Serves song lyrics from a MongoDB database.

### üîπ Database

- **MongoDB** for storing and retrieving song lyrics
- **SQLite** for managing Django application data

### üîπ Main Application

- **Django** for core web application (MVC structure)
- **Django Templates** for rendering views
- **Django Auth** for user registration and login

### üîπ Deployment

- **IBM Code Engine** for deploying the Pictures microservice
- **RedHat OpenShift** for deploying the Songs microservice and MongoDB
- **IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)** for deploying the main Django application

build a songs microservice in Flask.

This microservice works with MongoDB database to store lyrics of the most popular songs of the band. You will be using the PyMongo python module to interact with MongoDB programatically.

Action Method Return code Body URL Endpoint
List GET 200 OK Array of songs [{...}] GET /song
Create POST 201 CREATED A song resource as json {...} POST /song
Read GET 200 OK A song as json {...} GET /song/{id}
Update PUT 200 OK A song as json {...} PUT /song/{id}
Delete DELETE 204 NO CONTENT "" DELETE /song/{id}
Health GET 200 OK "" GET /health
Count GET 200 OK "" GET /count
