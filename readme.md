# 🎸 BandConnect

## **BandConnect** is a full-stack capstone project that brings fans closer to their favorite music band. The platform allows users to view concert pictures, read song lyrics, check upcoming events, register for concerts, and manage their reservations — all in one seamless experience.

## 🧱 System Architecture

![System Design](system_architecture.png)

This diagram shows the interaction between the user, Django main site, Flask microservices, and the databases:

- **Django** runs on IBM Kubernetes Service and interacts with:
  - A Flask microservice on IBM Code Engine (pictures)
  - A Flask + MongoDB microservice on RedHat OpenShift (songs)
- Data is stored in **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **IBM Cloud Object Storage**.

    | ------ | ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
    | List   | GET    | 200 OK         | Array of picture URLs `[{...}]`    | `/picture`      |
    | Create | POST   | 201 CREATED    | A picture resource as JSON `{...}` | `/picture`      |
    | Read   | GET    | 200 OK         | A picture as JSON `{...}`          | `/picture/{id}` |
    | Update | PUT    | 200 OK         | A picture as JSON `{...}`          | `/picture/{id}` |
    | Delete | DELETE | 204 NO CONTENT | `""`                               | `/picture/{id}` |

  - **Get Songs Service**
    Serves song lyrics from a MongoDB database.

### 🔹 Database

- **MongoDB** for storing and retrieving song lyrics
- **SQLite** for managing Django application data

### 🔹 Main Application

- **Django** for core web application (MVC structure)
- **Django Templates** for rendering views
- **Django Auth** for user registration and login

### 🔹 Deployment

- **IBM Code Engine** for deploying the Pictures microservice
- **RedHat OpenShift** for deploying the Songs microservice and MongoDB
- **IBM Kubernetes Service (IKS)** for deploying the main Django application
